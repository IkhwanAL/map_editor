# MAP EDITOR + Procedural Generator

I just came up this idea because it's fun and challenge my current skill (2025-12-10)

## Approach

Since This is New Project My Approach is simple, i just want to make it work and if it worth to continue that i will push this Project

## List
- A Simple Map
- A Simple Algorithm For Procedural Generator
- A Simple Way To Communicate Between Server and Client

## Concern

I think there still a bug in perlin noise, but i cant prove it yet
after i change the frequency, persistence, lacunarity, octaves it gone. Or maybe that just how it behaves
